**About the book:**
The Sixth Generation (6G) technology is latest approach for mobile systems or edge devices in terms of reduce
traffic congestions, energy consumption blending with IoT devices applications. The 6G network works beyond the 5G (B5G), where we
can use various platforms as an application e.g., fog computing enabled IoT networks, Intelligent techniques for SDN network, 6G
enabled healthcare industry, energy aware location management. Still this technology has to resolve few challenges like security, IoT
enabled trust network. This book provides emerging research exploring the theoretical and practical aspects of successfully
implementing new and innovative of intelligent techniques in a variety of sectors including 6G, Fog Computing, Cloud Computing,
Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence. This book will become a source of incentives for the academician, IT specialists, industry
professionals, researcher, engineers and authors seeking current research in emerging perspectives in the field of 6G enabled fog
computing for IoT applications.
