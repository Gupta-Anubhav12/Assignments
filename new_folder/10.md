## What Is Credit Card Management?

Credit card management is the practice of keeping tabs on all your credit cards, including key features like your current balance (or balances), recent activity, payment due dates, debts, interest rates, and rewards. Credit cards come with a lot of information to keep in mind; that’s where credit card management can help.     

## Why Is Credit Card Management Important?

Credit cards are a really helpful tool for many different situations, whether that’s financing a large purchase or just online shopping. However, it’s also critical that credit card users actively manage their open accounts. Poorly managed credit cards can lead to bad financial outcomes, like credit card debt and dings on your credit score. If you have a habit of badly managing your credit card, it can make it much harder to get new credit cards in the future, as well as other types of loans.     

## 5 Tips for How to Manage a Credit Card

There’s no doubt that managing your credit card is important. But you might not know what the most important steps are. Here are 5 tips that you can follow to keep yourself on track and responsible, no matter what you use your credit card to purchase.     

### Tip-1: Always Pay By the Due Date

The Federal Trade Commission, which oversees and regulates many financial products like credit cards, recommends that the most important thing you do is pay your balance by the due date. Credit cards charge interest. That means that, if you don’t pay off your full balance, the remaining amount will increase at a certain rate (that’s your interest rate). Paying off your full balance, not just the minimum, is the only way to avoid paying interest.
35% of your FICO Score, making it essential to have strong credit.     

### Tip-2: Learn the Conditions and Vocabulary

When you get your first credit card, it will come with documentation outlining the terms and conditions of your account. While you don’t have to read the small print in one sitting or in one day, it’s crucial to go over it as soon as you get the card in your hands. Break it down section by section so you know exactly what you have access to and what your credit card company expects of you.
It’s also a good idea to remember the following vocabulary terms: - Some credit cards impose a yearly fee, called an annual fee, for the privilege of conducting business with them. - The annual percentage rate (APR) is the fee you’ll pay if you don’t pay off your amount in full. - The amount of money you have charged to your card at any particular moment is known as your balance. - A cash advance is a short-term cash loan that you can get through your credit card. - Your credit limit is the maximum amount you may charge on your card. - A grace period is a period during which you will not be charged any additional costs.     

### Tip-3: Determine When You’ll Use Your Card

Will you only use this card in an emergency? Expenses for travel? What about auto repairs? Shopping excursions for groceries? What about gas fill-ups? Before you start using it on a daily basis, figure out what your own boundaries are.
It’s possible to wing it, but you don’t want to start doing so without any guidelines or personal boundaries. Begin with increasing modest expenditures such as gas or groceries while familiarizing yourself with how everything works. You want to make minor purchases that you can pay off quickly before each payment cycle ends.
While it may be tempting to spend as much as possible in the hopes of paying it off later, you don’t want to fall into this trap. Determine what recurrent bills are manageable for you to pay on time, for example, to create a solid credit history. Assume you spend less than $100 each month. To create good financial habits, make a payment for the full amount on or before the due date.     

### Tip-4: Always Monitor Your Credit Card Activity

Take the time to examine your credit card bills and/or charges online, as there are so many options to do so.
Not only are you ensuring that each transaction is legitimate, but it also allows you to see precisely where and how your card is being used. If something doesn’t appear to be correct, call your lender right away to get it corrected.     

### Tip-5: Manage Any Debt Responsibly

You’re essentially taking out a modest short-term debt when you use a credit card. The loan’s terms state that it must be repaid at the end of each month. When you don’t pay off your credit card bill each month, debt builds up. Even if you make the smallest payment—usually a fraction of the total amount, such as $30 or $50—interest will begin to build on the remaining balance. Credit card debt may have a serious impact on your finances over time. If you find yourself with mounting credit card debt, it’s critical that you have a plan for dealing with it. Use Mint’s credit card payoff calculator to figure out your payoff timeline and make a plan.     

## What Is the Best Way to Manage Credit Cards?

The best way to manage cards is carefully and actively, preferably with a simple app-based solution. There’s no one-size-fits-all strategy, and your credit card management strategy will likely have to work closely with your general budgeting strategies.     

## Conclusion - Manage Your Credit Cards Responsibly & Reap the Benefits

Credit card management is essential to financial health. Credit cards make modern living quick, efficient, and easy—plus many credit cards come with perks and rewards. However, reaping those benefits requires you to always keep a careful eye on the way that you use your credit cards.
