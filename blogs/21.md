## Content Writing

This one’s a no-brainer! The only way your blog will succeed is if you know how to write quality content and deliver value to your readers through your blog post. Only through unique, engaging, and useful content can you have a thriving profitable blog.
While you don't have to be a published author to compose a blog post, it is critical to have basic knowledge about how to write the content for your blog, such as word usage, writing style, citations, and length of the post.
The most important trait that any blogger needs is passion for their topic. If you are not interested in what you are blogging about, it will show in your writing and readers will not want to stick around on your blog for long periods of time. By choosing topics that interest you, it will make the process of writing much easier. Plus, if readers see that you love what you write about, they are likely going to like it too!

## Photo Editing

Humans are more attracted to visuals than paragraphs of text-heavy content, as with visuals it’s to understand the ideas behind the blog post and makes the information a lot more engaging and interesting to read.
Visuals have the potential of going viral on social media and are very useful to increase the overall search ranking for your blog on Google.
If you are sourcing images from websites, learn how to cite your images correctly to avoid plagiarism, or pick out appropriate images from Creative Commons websites without any copyright restrictions.
Possessing basic photo editing skills is highly necessary to manage a successful blog.
The good news is that there are tools such as Canva and SparkPost that are easy-to-use and beginner-friendly.
So, yes! You don’t need to be a pro but you need to have basic photo editing skills to thrive in the blogging universe.

## SEO and analytics

To earn a solid revenue through your blog and make it successful, it needs to rank very high on search engine result pages. To do this, specific SEO keywords or the most searched words related to your topic are added to the content to make it optimizable for it to run on the first page of Google.
Through this, your blog is deemed as an authentic and authoritative source for information.
Writing great headlines and SEO-rich meta-descriptions, using internal linking, and choosing a smart URL for your blog will give it a high click-through rate on Google, sending it to the top of the page.
Similarly, Google Analytics tracks blog traffic, site visitors, and the number of conversions that have taken place through your blog.
Even though most blog hosting websites have SEO and Google Analytics plug-ins, it is always a better approach to use these tools manually. Through SEO and Google Analytics results, you can understand how well your blog is doing, what improvements you should be making, and what you must avoid for having a successful blog.

## Networking and art of selling

One of the most important skills a blogger should possess is to know how to network with other bloggers.
Not only does it help form a relationship with other bloggers but also increases the chances for more traffic on your website and conversions from reader to customer.
You can join relevant social media groups on Facebook and LinkedIn or also Slack channels where you’re likely to meet like-minded people in your niche.
Next, the number one rule and the most desired skill you can acquire for anyone in marketing or business is to know the art of selling. After all, blogging is a business.
Avoid sounding like you are making a general sales pitch, instead, be genuine and think like an expert. Take advice from professional bloggers and learn by looking at how they close their deals and sell online.
Read books or articles about marketing, business, psychology, and how you can hone your selling skills to get better at showcasing your products and learn how to sell like a pro.

## HTML and CSS

Learning how to “code” a bit for your blog post might sound extremely daunting and scary for newbie bloggers who aren’t very technologically advanced. But don’t stress about it!
You don't have to be a web developer to understand the necessities of using codes on your blog. Having basic knowledge about HTML or CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is always an extra advantage for your blog to run smoother and faster.
Although various blog hosting websites like WordPress will let you create content without any coding involved, it is good practice to know simple elements like how to interlink images and hyperlink texts, add alt tags, include H1-H2 heading tags, etc.
Using these codes will help your blog look professional, neater, and structured. You can add additional widgets and plug-ins to your business blog, and pitch to readers or investors to increase your blog’s marketability.
