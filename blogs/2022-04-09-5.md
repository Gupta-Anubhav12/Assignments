## 8 ways to repurpose your content

### Create a blog

Blogging is the oldest form of content marketing. In fact, when we think of content marketing, a lot of the strategies that come to mind are written content, such as emails, blog posts, and newsletters. But, when done well, blogging can be more than just a means of communicating with your audience.

Rather, it can be a vehicle for building a relationship with your customers and prospects. As content starts to build a relationship over time, your audience will feel a sense of loyalty toward your brand. This loyalty can lead to them sharing your content and returning to your website on a regular basis.

### Publish case studies

A case study is the detailed analysis of a product or service intended to give the reader insight into the features and functions, the benefits, and the comparisons with competing products.

Case studies are highly versatile and can be used for many different types of content marketing. Whether your aim is to inform, entertain, or inspire, case studies can deliver on all these.

Case studies are a great way of demonstrating the value your product or service provides and can be used to show how your product solves an issue, solves problems, or changes the way a certain industry works.

### Conduct surveys

A survey is a questionnaire designed to collect information from a population of respondents. Surveys can be used for many different types of content marketing and can be especially useful for gathering feedback from your customers.

By asking your audience questions about their experiences with your brand and the product or service you provide, you can gain insight into what your audience likes, dislikes, wants, or needs.

You can also use surveys to gather data about your target audience. This can help you find specific groups of people who may have the desire to buy your product but have not yet found it.

### Create eBooks

Creating eBooks for your business is a great way to share detailed information about your products, services and how they can solve your customers&#39; problems.

Ebooks can also be used to train new employees or provide instructions on how a certain process works.

By creating ebooks, you can save a lot of time and money compared to training videos. You can create ebooks that are highly engaging and easy to read and are perfect for introducing your products and services to a global audience.

### Create video tutorials

Video content is extremely engaging. In fact, a recent study found that people are more likely to click on a video than a written article. Furthermore, people are also more likely to share a video than a written post, which means you&#39;re reaching an even wider audience than just your followers.

People love videos, and with good reason. Humans have been drawn to visual content for millennia. It is much easier to remember, understand, and act upon information when you receive it visually rather than when you read it.

That&#39;s why visual content is so important. It allows you to tell your story, tell your brand, and ultimately build your business.

### Write an article marketing newsletter

A marketing newsletter is a great way to share content with your customers and clients. By creating a newsletter, you can save your audience from having to hunt through your blog for new content.

You can also create custom segments within your marketing newsletter to target specific types of leads or customers.

### Create Podcasts

What if you could turn your blog into an audio series? That&#39;s precisely what you can do with podcasts. Once again, podcasts have been around for a long time â€” likely much longer than you&#39;ve been alive. But for some reason, they&#39;re experiencing a resurgence in popularity.

What&#39;s the reason for this? Well, for one thing, they&#39;re easy to create. You can use tools like Apple&#39;s GarageBand or Google&#39;s built-in platform to record your voice, add some music, and export your creation as a standalone MP3 file or as part of a larger podcasting app.

You can also choose to record your podcasts on your smartphone. This is a great way to create podcasts on the go, in between customers, or while on the road.

### Create Infographics

What are infographics? They&#39;re visuals designed to explain complex topics in a simple, digestible way. Infographics have been around since the dawn of time, and for a good reason. Not only do people love them, but research shows they&#39;re also one of the most effective types of content when it comes to engagement. That&#39;s why you&#39;ll see so many businesses creating and sharing infographics these days.

Why is it such a good idea to create infographics? Because they can help you create more content that creates a greater impact. Let&#39;s say you have a blog post that covers the &quot;Top 10 Benefits of Using \_\_\_\_&quot; as an ice-breaker for a customer chat. You could then turn that blog post into an infographic and save yourself some time.

You can also create an infographic to highlight the most common FAQs your business gets from customers. This is a great way to increase your brand engagement and build a stronger relationship with your customers.
