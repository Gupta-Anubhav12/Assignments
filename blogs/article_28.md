# Crowdfunding for Startups: A Best Way to Raise Funds
What will you do when you can’t get investors to fund your business or you can’t reach out to them to pitch your startup? Unless you have pockets filled with cash, you don’t have many options left. That’s where funding from the masses comes in.
According to a recent report on Startups.com, around 50 percent of crowdfunded campaigns are successful. And, more than 75% of campaigns exceed their target goal.
Many startups have become successful after getting crowdfunded. And, this process of getting a small amount of cash from a lot of people to start a business venture is called ‘crowdfunding’.
In this article, you will learn about crowdfunding and its types, the scope of crowdfunding for startups, and raising capital from the general public the right way.
## What is Crowdfunding?
Crowdfunding is the use of small amounts of capital from a large number of individuals to finance a new business venture. It makes use of vast networks of people through social media and crowdfunding websites to bring investors and entrepreneurs together, and has the potential to increase entrepreneurship by expanding the pool of investors from whom funds can be raised beyond the traditional circle of owners, relatives and venture capitalists.
The best part about crowdfunding is that companies take the money as an advanced booking of the product. This means the fundraising individuals get their products as soon as the company completes the production. If the company doesn’t reach its goal, the platform will return all the money to all the fund-raisers through an automated system.
All crowdfunding websites including Indiegogo, Kickstarter, Fundable, and Patreon offer this trusted system. And, this is what has led to an increase in crowdfunding in the last few years.
What makes it a more lucrative way to get funds instead of an investment or equity funding, is because most people will easily donate for advance booking of the products that the startup produces.
## Types of Crowdfunding for Startups
There are many types of Crowdfunding for startups. From crowdfunding that helps with donations to equity-based crowdfunding that helps the backers earn more profit from it. The reason crowdfunding is so popular is because it is easy, secure, and accessible to everyone. Let’s learn about the types of crowdfunding in more detail.
1. Reward Based Crowdfunding: In this, backers contribute to your project for non-financial benefits. This type of reward based funding is popular in creative projects where the backers will receive a token of appreciation or free gifts for funding the project. Sites like Kickstarter, Indiegogo and many others operate on this business model.
2. Donation Based Crowdfunding: This is for charities that are working for a social cause. One website that’s famous for donations is GoFundMe.
Users just create a cause and then distribute the link of the campaign among their peers. They set a goal and all the amount collected is sent to the account of the person who has created the campaign.
3. Equity-Based Crowdfunding: This is meant to get a return on the invested amount. It is popular in the stock market where people buy shares of various stocks and redeem them when the prices rise.
It is also a great way for startups to get money for their initiative. But they will have to sign a contract that they will provide equity to the shareholders or return their money if the project fails.
4. Debt Crowdfunding: This is when backers provide money in exchange for interest or higher markup. The debt crowdfunding option is usually practiced by banks and lending companies.
## Pros and Cons of Crowdfunding
Like any other funding campaign, crowdfunding also has its fair share of pros and cons. First, let’s discuss the pros of crowdfunding.
Pros of Crowdfunding
No-Risk Involved: One of the benefits of crowdfunding for startups is that it doesn’t involve any risks. You simply have to create a compelling campaign and bring it in front of the public. If they like it, they will fund it. Moreover, your product automatically gets exposed to a lot of potential customers.
Get As Much Funding As You Desire: Another benefit of crowdfunding is that you can set a goal for your funding amount without paying any equity. This amount can range from $10,000 to $100,000. 
Sell Products In Advance: Another great benefit of crowdfunding is that you can sell products in advance against the funding received. This is how most campaigns on Kickstarter work.
Cons of Crowdfunding
Pressure Builds Up: A disadvantage of crowdfunding for startups is that you have to ship the products that you promise to the backers of your campaigns. If you don’t deliver the products on time, the backers are likely to complain to the authorities. Some of them can also file lawsuits.
No Payoff If Campaign Fails: There are chances that you will not get a single dollar if the campaign fails. This means all the efforts you put in the campaign will go down the drain. You should note that more than 60% of crowdfunding campaigns fail. 
Hence, if you want to save yours, then take inspiration from the following campaign examples.
## Crowdfunding Examples to Take Some Inspiration
Here are some of the best crowdfunding examples that you can use to enhance your campaigns and increase their success ratio.
### Coolest Cooler Ever
There was this one campaign of a water cooler that can turn into a blender, music stereo, power bank, cutlery holder, etc. And guess what? This cooler is also named as the ‘coolest cooler.’ It garnered over $13 million in funding last year on Kickstarter and is now available in the market.
Why Was it Successful?
The reason it became so successful was that it offered people what they consider essential for outdoor tours including power banks, juicers, ice cooler, and much more – all in a single product. The cherry on top is its marketing campaign that includes an attractive video advertisement. The best part is that it asked people to get the complete cooler with all perks by funding the $165 only.
### Everyday Backpack
This product has been so successful that all top news publications including The Guardian, Wall Street, Buzzfeed, Mashable, and many more have covered it.
It has gathered over $6 million in funding on Kickstarter. The product is made by photographers for everyday travelers who want comfort and style.
Why Was it Successful?
People love simple travel bags. The everyday bags are packed full of features and meticulously engineered. Besides, their promo video shows all the features in all their glory. That is one solid reason behind their success.
## Ready to Launch Your Crowdfunding Campaign?
Crowdfunding for startups is great when a startup doesn’t have access to investors. They can simply launch a great campaign on a crowdfunding website and get funding from the public for their product.
But, there is a catch! Crowdfund isn’t there to sustain your business for the long-term. This means unlike equity-based funding, you can’t get crowdfunding again and again for the same product. Once you have the funds, make sure to make your business successful and deliver what you have promised the public against their money.
That’s it. We hope you are now familiar with crowdfunding campaigns, their types, and how they can help you raise funding in a short amount of time. If you are still unclear about one or more concepts we have discussed in this article, simply comment below.
