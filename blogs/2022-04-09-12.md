As a business owner, you want to grow your business, and blog posts are one of the best ways to attract more customers. But who has the time to write quality content? In fact, writing might be the last thing you want to do.
You may think of writing as a solitary, slow, and painstaking activity. That's mostly true. It is an activity that requires a lot of focus, concentration, and time. However, it doesn't have to be slow. And you don't have to do it all by yourself (Really!).
In fact, there are several hacks you can use to speed up the writing process and make it more enjoyable at the same time. This blog post will walk you through the entire process of How to write a blog post faster while also maintaining quality (or even improving it).
The best part is these techniques will save you a ton of time and effort - allowing you to focus on other things that matter.

## Step 1 - Start with a content planner

Plan out your content in advance. Brainstorm as many ideas for your blog as you can and write them down, so you don't forget them. Once your brainstorm session is over and every idea has been written down, go back through the list and delete all duplicates or those that can be grouped with another post.
Now, organize all these posts into a content planner or calendar. Content planners make it easier to manage your thoughts and ideas. Start with the most important one first. Arrange them accordingly using bullet points or headings, so they are easy to read and follow.
If you're having trouble coming up with ideas, think about what you might like to read on a blog. To speed up your brainstorming process, determine how much time you'd like to spend on each post and set aside time in your schedule accordingly. 

## Step 2 - Research

The second step of the blog writing process is to do detailed research. This means you need to head out and find the most up-to-date, relevant information on your chosen topic. This phase is one of the most critical parts of the article writing process because it will give you plenty of ideas to work with.
Research is particularly important when you're writing about a topic where you aren't an expert. If you're writing a piece on the advantages of social media marketing, you've got plenty of experience to draw on and may not need to do much research. But if you're writing about the pros and cons of organic foods or how to train an iguana, then it's time to hit the web.
You can use all kinds of resources for your research, including books, magazines, academic journals, websites, blogs, forums, newspapers, and trade publications. Researching your competitors' blogs will also help you understand what type of content they are publishing, what format they use, and how often they post. This will also give you a good idea about the type of content that works in your particular niche, so you can discover the best way to approach your audience.


## Step 3 - Create an SEO strategy

SEO (search engine optimization) is a set of techniques aimed at improving the visibility of web pages in search engines. The most effective method for optimizing both organic and paid listings on major search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo!, and YouTube is by adding metadata tags, including meta titles, descriptions, and keywords which describe their content.
A comprehensive SEO strategy for your blog post would involve researching the right keywords and optimizing its content so that it is visible in search engines like Google & Bing. Keyword research will help you find what words to use as tags because people often type these into search bars when they are looking for something specific or just browsing online. You can include some of those exact words in your article title, headings, subheadings, and throughout the text itself to make sure that readers see them easily when doing a keyword search.


## Step 4 - Deciding the type of blog & its outline

Before you go on writing, consider what type of blog post you want to create. This decision is important because some blog posts perform better than others when it comes to generating traffic from search engines.
For instance, how-to blog posts tend to perform very well in search engine results pages (SERPs) because many people search for instructions on how to do something.
Once you have a fair idea of what to write about, the next step is to create a detailed outline for the blog post. Before you get into writing your actual blog post, it is important that you create an outline of your ideas. This will help you manage and structure your content so that it flows properly.
Once your outline is complete, transfer each point into a word document and expand on it with any additional details that may come up as you write. This outline will act as the structure for your post. It will help you structure your thoughts and determine what information you want to include in your blog post.
There are different methods for creating an outline, but it doesn't matter what method you use. The important thing is that you have an outline so that you have a road map for where you want to go with your post.


## Step 5 - The First Draft

A blog post is a work of art, and like any other work of art, it should be revised many times. But the first step is simply to start writing and let your ideas flow without trying to make them perfect.
The first draft is usually a mess. The first draft of this post was more than twice as long; we cut most of it out. The first draft of one of our newsletters was about four times longer. A good writer will cut out most of what he writes, like a sculptor carving an angel from a block of marble.
You don't have to write all of your posts at once. Try aiming for 300 words and then you can always come back and add more after you've finished the first draft.
If you're stuck thinking about what to write, try reading through other people's blog posts for inspiration or looking at the most popular posts on Medium from the last few months.


## Step 6 - Editing & Formatting

After you've written your blog post, make sure to edit it. To speed up your editing process, you can reserve a room or coffee shop for at least 30 minutes and go through the entire post. Change the font for your draft to something not so easy on the eyes (Comic Sans will do). This will help you read every word of your copy instead of gliding over it. Read it aloud, slowly. This will help you figure out typos and awkward phrasing. Turn off your internet connection, if possible, so that you're not distracted by social media or emails. .
There's a lot more than just writing a great blog post. You also have to make sure the blog format is reader-friendly and visually appealing. If you want your writings to be taken seriously, it's essential to make sure they look professional from start to finish. Formatting a blog is not as easy as it might seem. It takes time, patience, and a systematic approach to get it done right.


## Step 7 - Proofread

Proofreading your blog post before publishing is so important because it ensures that the content you put out on the web is perfect. Most people think that proofreading means reading through your entire article and correcting any spelling mistakes or grammatical errors. While that could be one way to look at it, here's what it actually includes.
Proofreading should include everything from correcting spelling mistakes and grammar to making sure your post is easily readable and making sure you have a good flow throughout your article. It's really amazing how many errors you can find in a single article when you really dig deep into the text.
You don't have to be a blog expert to write a good blog post, but you should know some basic rules. But, when you're trying to get your point across — especially if it's a complex idea — little mistakes can stand in the way of readers' understanding. And when they get confused, they leave. Proofreading helps you overcome that obstacle.


## Conclusion

To write an impressive blog post, you need to research a topic, compose a solid introduction, include relevant examples, provide a conclusion and finally write a headline.
