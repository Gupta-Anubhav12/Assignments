# 4 Telltale Signs You Need Serious Help as a Developer


Recognize the problem and succeed, or ignore it and suffer in your career. The choice is yours.
It is common to find developers struggling in their day-to-day activities. They put in a lot of sincere effort to give their best. But once in a while, every programmer finds it challenging to finish their assignments in time or produce quality code.
Competent developers among us know where they are lacking. They avoid dwelling on the problems. Instead, they reach out to acquire the best assistance possible.
However, not every software engineer is capable enough to recognize their limitations and take the necessary measures. They either remain oblivious or in denial and end up hurting their career in the long term.
This article will discuss five telltale signs that signify you need serious help as a developer. If you identify with any of these, take action today without procrastinating.
## 1. You constantly struggle to understand requirements
The foundation for any good code is a clear understanding of the requirement. If a developer does not understand their business request, they cannot produce quality code. Even with excellent programming skills, they will fail during the implementation phase.
If you frequently struggle to understand what your customers or stakeholders want, it might be time to get some help.
But don’t lose your heart. It is easier to improve on this sign than you imagine. No developer understands a company’s business from day one. It takes time and effort to get good at it.
What can you do?
Never accept a task if you don’t understand the requirement. Ask as many questions until you clarify all your doubts.
Focus your questions on the ‘why’ and ‘how’ of the requirement. Why does your business need the feature? How does the feature help them achieve their goal?
Spend time learning the broader functionality of your application. Ask your seniors or product owner to provide regular knowledge transfer about the product’s behavior.
For each new requirement, relate the ask with the current functionalities. Having this knowledge can help you implement the new requirements without affecting existing features.
## 2. You struggle to find the root cause and fix defects
There are many developers who find it hard to troubleshoot issues. Give them a defect to analyze, and they will have no clue where to start looking. They often lack the skill to approach a problem systematically.
Learning how to tackle a problem is one of the most challenging aspects of programming. It requires a combination of analytical skills, functional knowledge, code understanding, and a curious mind.
To efficiently root cause issues, you also need to be good at debugging.
As a programmer, you need to debug code irrespective of who wrote it. You cannot say you will look into issues in your code only. Once you are part of a team, you are responsible for the entire application.
Finding the root cause and fixing defects is the core function of programmers. A developer who cannot perform these two tasks effortlessly will struggle to grow in their career.
Hence, as a developer, if you find it difficult to root cause issues and fix defects, it is a clear indication that you need help.
What can you do?
Code is the bible. Please read it. Very few people spend time reading existing code.
Tag along with your seniors while they are debugging. Learn the tricks and tips from them on how to debug efficiently. Pairing up is the next best thing to learn the skill.
Learn how to use the debugger feature in your code editor. You will be surprised how modern debugging tools make running through code a breeze and troubleshooting issues effortless.
Don’t be afraid to pick up a defect. Fix as many issues as you can. The more defects you fix, the more confident you will become in the skill.
## 3. You struggle to see beyond problems
Developers are innate problem solvers. Solving problems through their code is what they do for a living. This is precisely why a developer position is so important in an organization.
However, many developers find themselves clueless while approaching an issue. When they face a problem outside of their comfort zone, they prefer to complain about it instead of accepting their inability to solve it.
The problem can be environmental, people, or requirement issues.
If you frequently complain without any suggestion on how to solve it, it is a huge sign you need help as a developer.
At the same time, when people offer help, don’t try to prove the problem is bigger than anyone can resolve. Every software engineer’s workplace problem has a solution or a workaround. You just need to open yourself up to be helped.
What can you do?
Problem-solving is all about breaking the problem into smaller chunks and then finding a solution for each of them. Hence, don’t try to solve world hunger in one day. Break down your assignments into smaller logical chunks until you feel comfortable working on them.
If the issues are environmental, don’t complain too much about them. Every work environment has its share of problems. It is better to discuss it with your manager and let them handle it appropriately.
Whenever possible, think about how you can help resolve an issue. Instead of wasting time cribbing about the problem, put effort into fixing it.
Observe how competent members of your team approach similar issues. You can learn a lot from people who are good at handling workplace problems independently.
## 4. You constantly feel overworked and overwhelmed
One of the most common signs that you need help as a developer is when you feel overwhelmed or overworked. This usually happens when you try to do too much work without having the skills or energy to handle them.
Often good developers fall into the trap of overloading themselves with too many assignments. They have good intentions. They want to complete as many tasks as possible and help the team achieve the delivery goals.
However, in their eagerness to contribute, such developers fail to assess their abilities accurately. Eventually, as the work pressure increases, they cannot scale down their expectations with the rest of the team.
This behavior leads to frustration and feeling of helplessness. Hence, it is better to get help before pushing yourself to the brink of a breakdown.
What can you do?
Acknowledge that you are feeling overwhelmed. This is the first step to resolving the issue.
Don’t be shy in saying you cannot take up something. You are not supposed to do everything that gets assigned to you. Accept only the amount of work you are comfortable with and have the necessary skill set to perform.
Delegate tasks appropriately and let others share the workload.
If your team is not coming forward, discuss it with your manager. Mention why you cannot complete the tasks within the given time and ask them to help delegate.
## Final Thoughts
As a developer, never forget that there is still hope when everything appears lost.
All you need to do is identify the signs and get help. Don’t let your insecurity prevent you from receiving assistance and solving the issues.
No one is perfect, and everyone makes mistakes. So, don’t be afraid to seek guidance. With perseverance, you can overcome your challenges and achieve extraordinary success in your career.
