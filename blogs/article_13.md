In fact, besides your time, this shouldn’t cost you more than 200 bucks for editing, cover design, and publishing.

You don’t have to be an expert in a particular topic or the best writer in the world to write a best-selling book either. After all, writers, editors, or cover page designers can be outsourced if you need assistance.
## 7. Graphic Design

Often, this work may include marketing materials, brand and logo campaigns, labels, and product packaging.
There are several online job boards that post graphic design work, including Behance, Fiverr, Guru, UpWork, FlexJobs, Indeed, and many more. Besides these online job sites, networking sites such as LinkedIn and Alignable can connect you with local employers.
To get started, create a portfolio page on your website to showcase your graphic design skills. Also, don’t forget to display samples of your work on visual-focused social media sites like Instagram. When pitching graphic design work to local businesses, this will also help you build credibility.
## 8. Airbnb
You probably already know about Airbnb, and it can be a solid source of passive income for anyone who has an extra room or is willing to rent out their entire house.
As with any side hustle, listing your space on Airbnb isn’t completely passive or online. After all, you still have to tidy up the place for the guests, be there to answer questions, and clean up after the guests leave. Of course, you can outsource these tasks or use platforms like YourFront Desk.
Regardless, as long as you have the right location and make your listing pop, it’s possible to make six figures renting out space on Airbnb. To make your listing as eye-catching as possible, make sure that you develop a captivating headline, post stunning photos, and provide a detailed description of your property.
