# Ten Tips to Help Your College Club Bloom on Discord
In the digital age, online communication has become a staple of college life. From group projects to social outings, students are turning to the internet to stay connected
​​Discord is a social media application that allows groups of people to communicate with each other via voice and text chat. It can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, chatting with friends, or collaborating on a project. For college students, Discord can be a great way to connect with other students who share their interests and form a club. Here are ten tips to help your college club bloom on Discord.
## Make Use of the Channel Feature
An issue that you might’ve encountered when using other messaging platforms is attempting to make a club announcement in a group chat, only for it to be immediately buried under an avalanche of incoming messages. This difficulty in communicating can prevent you from delivering important messages to your club members.
One of the biggest advantages of using Discord is the ability to keep your club communications organized using Channels. Channels are the fundamental building blocks to a Discord server, especially when being used for a club or organization.
You can set up multiple types of channels, each with its own purpose — here are a few types of channels that are essential for making your community feel at home.
Announcement Channels: A popular channel for clubs that I always help set up is #announcements. Having a separate channel that contains important club messages will ensure that your club will always know where to find the latest information!
Resources and Q-and-A: Having these types of channels will encourage the growth of your community as club members can use them to support each other. 
Private Channels: Private channels are another type of channel that you may find beneficial — they’re only visible to those you give permission to view and are fantastic for smaller group communication. 
Stage Channels: Stage channels allow you to share a focused conversation with select individuals to an audience of listeners — they’re great to use for meetings that mainly consist of members listening rather than everyone speaking, such as with club presentations or guest speakers. 
## Make Your Server Feel Like Home
Get creative with it! You can personalize your channel’s names to match your club’s culture. 
Have a Dungeons and Dragons club? Name your general channel “the-dungeon!” Making your server’s channels feel like an extension of your niche or location is a sure-fire way to create a welcoming environment and increase your club’s engagement.
Personalizing your server with familiar touches will make your members feel nostalgic and more connected with your club community, which is especially important during COVID-19 when many are unable to meet in person.
## Welcome Your Club Members
Your new members may be intimidated by the move to a newer platform if not given a proper introduction to its features, especially if it’s their first time on Discord. Counter this by creating a read-only welcome page that explains the basics of Discord, what each channel is used for, and the culture of the server. On your welcome page, make it clear that members are not only welcome but encouraged to hop onto voice channels at any time to chat with other members that may already be in there. Those new to the platform may initially feel hesitant, but this reassurance will come a long way in establishing your server. 
When new members join the server, you can also welcome them in the chat and watch as your fellow members join in!
## Play Your ROLE in Making Your Club Easier to Navigate
Both new and long-time members in large organizations can often have trouble identifying who the officers of a club are. Even with brief introductions, it’s easy to forget and become confused on who to DM with questions — even outside of clubs!
This issue becomes nonexistent with the usage of roles! Clubs will often assign the Officer role to their officers so other members can easily identify them, and let’s be honest, flexing that shiny “Officer” title doesn’t seem too shabby either!
Roles can be used in a variety of different ways such as providing a way for members to find others who share similar interests or backgrounds with them. You can set up popular topics for roles such as favorite games, majors, interests, etc.
## Bots, Bots, Bots
After setting up the basics of your server, bots are a great way to help your server reach its full potential by automating a lot of the heavy lifting. Below are some great starting points to the wide world of Bots!
Want a bot that can automatically assign roles to members? Meet Carl-bot.
Want a bot that can automatically warn or ban anyone that’s behaving inappropriately on your server? Check out MEE6.
Want to send out fun polls to see what everyone’s favorite sandwich is? Ask them using EasyPoll!
Want a bot where you play an economy game that revolves around managing your very own taco shack? One word: TacoShack.
The possibilities of bots are pretty much endless. 
## Attract New Members with Invite Links
Joining a new organization or club can be nerve-wracking. Potential members are often faced with different challenges, whether it be joining a club full of strangers or lacking information to get started. Oftentimes, the anxiety or amount of effort it takes to go to that first meeting can prevent members from joining your club. That’s a lot of potential members — and potential friends — that are lost.
Invite Links for your server can help with publicizing your server through social media or your school’s club directory. This allows students to easily scope out your club at their convenience and receive updated information. You’d be surprised how many people are interested in your club but just haven’t gathered up the courage or motivation to join!
Invite links are also convenient. Unlike other platforms where you have to tediously add new members, you won’t even have to lift a finger! (Outside of generating the link of course.)
## Host events!
Hosting virtual events is a surefire way to bring your community closer together and increase engagement in your server. Some events that can be successful for your club include game nights, movie nights, and trivia nights. There’s a wide variety of fun multiplayer games to choose from, such as Skribbl.io, Jackbox, and Gartic Phone, and using Screenshare can help! Try asking your members to vote on a movie they want for movie night. And, trivia can also be a great way to bring out your members’ competitive side and test out their knowledge. Up the stakes and increase engagement further by offering a prize or two — Discord Nitro is easily giftable!
## Lead By Example
For the most important tip of all, lead by example. As amazing as Discord is, you won’t be able to use everything it has to offer to help your club reach its full potential if no one is using it! People will go where their community and leader takes them. When they see you talking, engaging, hosting events and answering QOTDs, they’ll be more inclined to break out of their shell and start engaging as well!
Imagine a place where it’s easy to talk every day and hang out more often. As leaders, you and your officer team will lead your club members onto their next great adventure. With Discord’s capability to build and maintain communities through challenges, whether it be thousands of miles or simply social distancing, your club will be unstoppable.
