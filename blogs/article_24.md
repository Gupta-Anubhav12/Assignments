# Cybersecurity In Healthcare: How to protect sensitive data stored online
Did you know? As per a recent report, the healthcare cybersecurity market will grow by $36 billion (at a CAGR of over 17.7%) in 2027.
Hospitals, medical practices, pharmacies, and other healthcare institutions store sensitive information about their patients on websites or other online platforms.
While it’s nice to make this information easily accessible so patients can check on appointments, pay bills, and more from home, this data also poses a great risk if an outside party gains access to it without authorization.
To keep your patients’ information safe from cybercriminals, you need to implement an effective cyber security plan that protects your sensitive data from potential hackers and other unauthorized users.
However, in the fast-paced world of healthcare, it can be challenging to remember all the security measures you’re supposed to take to protect sensitive data and patient records.
This article covers some of the most important things you need to know about cyber security in healthcare so that you can protect your organization’s confidential information.
## 1. Ensure Staff is Trained on Healthcare Cyber Security Protocols
Anywhere you store sensitive information is a possible entry point for cyber security threats. That’s why it’s crucial to train your staff to spot and report problems quickly so you can fix them before they cause damage.
If your employees understand how certain threats could impact their system, they can help reduce risk by spotting signs of those threats and notifying administrators immediately.
This can make all the difference in stopping attacks from getting a foothold and extending beyond one employee’s computer to spreading through your entire system.
And in today’s world, where any device connected to a network may pose a threat, staff training is especially important for keeping sensitive data secure online.
So, make sure they are aware of the cyber security protocols in place and how to properly store and transmit sensitive information.
You can also require them to sign a confidentiality agreement that spells out the consequences of violating patient privacy. Moreover, you can also contact a custom software development company to develop an efficient healthcare app.
## 2. Control and limit access to protect patient data
Just because you aren’t storing data on paper doesn’t mean it isn’t vulnerable to attack. By controlling and limiting access to patient data, you can better protect sensitive information from getting into unintended hands.
Use technology to ensure only authorized users have access to vital information at all times. Set unique passwords for every user and change them periodically.
Consider using multifactor authentication as well — this requires a second passcode (something you have or something you are) in addition to your password, so hackers can’t get in if they happen upon your password. It’s time-consuming but worth it.
## 3. Perform risk assessments on a regular basis
Creating a regular schedule for performing security risk assessments can seem daunting, but it’s actually a great way to manage your cybersecurity efforts.
Regularly analyzing your data (and how it’s protected) is essential to catching new threats and keeping sensitive information safe. Research has shown that regular assessments could also reduce your company’s overall risk.
Because you’ll discover issues that you otherwise might not notice for months or years, so, take some time now to figure out when you’ll perform risk assessments — and then stick with that schedule.
## 4. Don’t Use the same password for everything
Creating a separate password for each account is one of the most important steps you can take to protect your data. A hacked account may lead to stolen money and stolen information such as social security numbers, health records, financial accounts, or credit card numbers.
Make sure you use unique passwords on every account with an irregular mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. And if you don’t remember them all right away, try using a password manager.
These tools can securely store your login credentials and automatically fill in your passwords when you log into a site with a single click.
Be careful, though — these programs often have their own vulnerabilities that could jeopardize your sensitive info; make sure they’re secure before logging in any sensitive data. Moreover, you can also get in touch with any healthcare mobile app development company to create a dynamic healthcare app.
## 5. Secure communication
If you need to communicate with patients, physicians, or anyone else whose data you’re storing in your electronic health record (EHR), there’s a chance that conversation is not secure.
Make sure you’re using a top-notch encryption program — and be wary of what information you’re actually sending and receiving. Don’t just assume all communication via email, for example, is automatically protected by encryption.
Be aware of what security protocols your EHR system uses and make sure those are in place when communicating with others who have access to your database.
However, by using secure communication tools, such as encryption software or virtual private networks (VPNs), you can save your data safely from prying eyes.
## 6. Device and service updates
Newer devices are often more secure than older ones. These days, it’s not uncommon to see an update that includes some security improvements with the release of a new device.
Moreover, It’s important to update software regularly on all devices that connect to your computer. That way, you stay on top of emerging issues and can promptly update any vulnerabilities as they are discovered.
It’s important to keep programs such as your operating system, web browser, antivirus, and firewall up-to-date because malicious hackers will often find new ways to infiltrate computers.
It’s also a good idea to use built-in tools whenever possible for updating applications (like Windows Update for Microsoft programs). You also don’t want malware disguised as an application or program update.
Thus, device updates should happen automatically; make sure services like those provided by Apple, Google, and Windows are set to automatic updates so that you don’t forget.
## 7. Install better software
The most significant step toward protecting your data is to ensure that you aren’t running old, outdated software. Outdated software — or unpatched software — is one of many common holes in healthcare cyber security.
It can be a conduit for hackers and other nefarious actors who are looking to access your computer network. A good way to check if any of your IT systems are out-of-date is by conducting an audit of all hardware and software components on all computers in your network.
This will give you insight into which pieces of hardware or applications may need updating, as well as what needs replacing entirely.
Moreover, you can also avail of healthcare app development services by hiring any healthcare software development company in your region.
## 8. Plan for an infringement and have a recovery plan
Health data breaches are common and often result in reputational damage and financial loss, whether to your business or your clients.
Prepare for a potential breach by following proper procedures in securing data, protecting access to sensitive information, and having a plan in place if something goes wrong. Taking these steps will help ensure you respond appropriately if an incident occurs.
Be sure to keep employees informed of potential risks related to cybersecurity with special training sessions on best practices (i.e., how not to click on suspicious links).
If an incident occurs, be sure that everyone knows what they need to do next — and whom they should call if they aren’t sure what happens next — in order to minimize exposure and prevent further damage from happening.
## Wrapping Up!
Cybersecurity is a crucial issue for businesses of any type, and healthcare providers are no exception. In order to protect your data, you need to take a multi-layered approach that includes using updated software, installing better software, and having a recovery plan in place in case of a breach.
Moreover, hackers these days are resourceful and persistent. They always try to look for new ways to infiltrate computers, steal sensitive data, or otherwise breach your networks’ security.
With this in mind, it’s important that healthcare providers take the necessary steps to protect their data. This includes providing multiprotocol end-to-end encryption solutions, using strong passwords and passphrases, and implementing device updates on all your hardware and software systems.
These efforts will increase cybersecurity and help prevent potential attacks from hurting you or your clients’ businesses.
