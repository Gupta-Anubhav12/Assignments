# Factors That Affect a Lender’s Decision on Your Loan


No one ever said getting a loan would be easy, and in fact, the process of acquiring a loan is often daunting.  From the initial application to the final approval, there are a number of factors that lenders take into account when making a decision on a loan.
While some of them are lenient when loaning the money, others can be remarkably strict. It’s also worth noting that every lender is different and may place a greater weight on different factors. This article will explore some of the most important factors that lenders take into account when deciding whether or not to approve a loan.
## Know what lenders are looking for
If your loan applications are often rejected, it is worth stepping back and examining the aspects of a lender's decision-making process that may be causing you difficulty.
When you’re applying for a mortgage, auto loan, personal loan, or any other loan, you want to get the best outcome. However, your loan application may not go well all the time. It’s because lenders consider a range of factors to ensure that they are extending the loan responsibly.
If you don’t know what your lender is looking for, it can be more difficult for you to get approval. It would be best to acquaint yourself with the different factors that may significantly affect a lender’s decision on your loan.
Before handing in your loan application, you may read through the following factors to help you get the most favorable response from your lender. Knowing them by heart can make the difference in qualifying for a loan and getting it at a good interest rate.
## How You Managed Your Credit
Typically, lenders will examine your credit report to know how you’ve managed your credit with other lenders in the past. Different relevant information that lenders are likely to see on your credit file, but your payment history will probably have a large bearing on your loan application.
If you didn’t incur missed or late payments in your past credit accounts, they may consider you creditworthy. But your payment history, along with other details in your credit report, is basically encapsulated in a single number known as credit scores. Such scores may range between 350-850, and the higher they are, the better off your loan application will be.
Your credit score is important because it can affect the interest rate you’ll be offered on a loan. A high credit score means you’ll be offered a lower interest rate, while a low credit score could lead to a higher interest rate and may even mean you won’t be approved for a loan. 
## How Much You’re Earning and Currently Owing
It is important to remember that lenders prefer loaning money to borrowers who they have confidence will repay the loan as agreed. With that, they will certainly use your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) to determine how much you’re earning and currently owing.
Although each lender has different requirements when it comes to your DTI ratio, they usually prefer a percentage that is not higher than 36%. If your monthly gross income is $5,000, your total monthly debts should not exceed $1,080. The lender’s goal is to make sure you have enough income to make payments on new debt.
There are a few things you can do to improve your DTI ratio and make yourself a more attractive borrower. One option is to pay off some of your current debts. Another is to increase your monthly income. If you can show the lender that you are capable of taking on more debt without struggling, you will be in a much better position to get approved for a loan.
## How Much You Want To Borrow and What It Is For
The amount you want to borrow and how you plan to use it can also affect a lender’s decision on your loan application. Basically, it’s one of the bases that lenders use to determine how much interest they will charge. If you borrow a larger amount, you are also likely to pay more interest on your loan. But a 20% down payment may help you get less interest.
Depending on the type of loan you’ll borrow, lenders may also require you to put up collateral. But they usually do that when you’re applying for a substantial amount. Lenders would want you to secure your loan so that they have a sort of protection if you miss payments. The loan purpose may also have some bearing on your application, depending on your lender.
## How Long You Can Repay The Loan
The length of time you’ll be paying the loan plays an important role in the lender’s decision. Note that they will usually feel more comfortable lending you the loan for a shorter time. It’s probably because you’re less likely to default on the loan if you have to pay it sooner. But of course, it would mean a higher monthly payment on your part.
## How Much Liquid Assets You Have
Lenders often take into account your liquid assets when you apply for loans like a mortgage, auto loan, or home equity loan. If they see that you have funds or assets that you can easily turn into cash, lenders may give you lower rates or better terms. It gives them reassurance that you have a financial cushion to fall back on quickly to make repayments even if you lose your job.
## What Are Your Options?
Besides the factors mentioned above, it’s worth noting that the type of lender you choose can also make a big difference on your loan application. If you want to increase your chances of approval, you may have to go to a lender that best suits your needs and qualifications.
It would help to get yourself acquainted with the following types of lenders and see where you most fit in.
### Traditional Lenders: Traditional lenders typically refer to banks and credit unions. For such a long time, they were only the sources for loans and lines of credit. Among all the available commercial lending options, traditional lenders may offer the best terms. But the problem is, they are harder to qualify for since they have stricter application requirements.
### Alternative Lenders: On the other hand, alternative lenders have been around for only a decade. They are also known as online lenders, and they are not subjected to the same level of regulation as banks and credit unions. They often have more lenient qualifications and much faster turnaround times than traditional ones. However, these lenders may charge higher interest rates.
## Conclusion
No one factor determines a lender's decision on a loan application - it is a culmination of many different factors. Some of the most important factors that lenders take into account include how you've managed your credit in the past, how much you want to borrow, what the loan is for, and how long you can repay the loan. It's important to be aware of these factors so you can improve your chances of being approved for a loan.
