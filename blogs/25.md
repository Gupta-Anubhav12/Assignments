# How To Find Meaning in Life: 9 Simple Ways

Do you ever wonder why on earth you are here? You know, like how to find meaning in life, or your purpose in life? Why do you actually exist on this planet?
These are probably the most subtle, yet profound, questions people ask themselves every day and there are various answers to these questions as there are people asking them, too.
Life can sometimes feel like one dark, long tunnel with no end in sight. Especially when you're going through a hard time, it can be difficult to see any meaning in your life. Maybe you're not happy at work, or maybe you don't know what career path to take. Or maybe you're just looking for some guidance on how to make the most of your day-to-day routine. The tips below will help guide you back towards the light and show you how to find meaning in your own life.

## Learn the Lesson on Happiness

Well, you might have heard it before: happiness is a choice. Yes, it is, and luckily it can be practiced by anyone because the truth is you can actually override what you were originally taught, which is to play along with the rest of the world and become upset or unhappy because things are not perfect.
Alright, it’s not always having a deluded smile on your face (people will think you’re crazy) but instead stay calm and stay happy, whilst dealing with situations that need your attention.

## Follow Your Gifts and Talents

Discovering your gifts and talents will give meaning to your life and can lead to finding your purpose. Here are a few questions that will help you discover what underlying gifts and talents you have:
What comes naturally to you?
When do you feel the best?
What are you doing or experiencing then?
In what way do you love to help other people?

## Make Great Connections

Spend time with the people that add to your life and lift you up. This could be anyone from friends to work colleagues. This will not just make you feel good but also productive enough.
Spend less time with people that drain your energy or constantly give negative vibes.
“You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.”
Begin to notice how you feel around others. (Hint: you should feel good.)

## Goal Setting

If you want meaning in life, this means having a plan. You don’t have to sit down for five hours every Monday setting goals for the rest of the week that you probably won’t complete anyway—please, don’t do this to yourself!
But do have goals and a plan for achieving them. It shouldn’t be one of those things you hate to do, but instead have an idea of accomplishments you would like to see happen in you life and make a plan for working towards them by writing them down. Then, most importantly, take action.

## Help Others

Helping other people helps you feel good, definitely makes you feel worthy, and gives you some sense of purpose. Giving to others in time, money or helping them out in any way you can is a sure way to give yourself meaning in life.
So, the question is this: Do you know anyone you can help this week? If yes, then what are you waiting for? Try to help them in the best possible way.

## Do Something Different

How about going to a museum, having lunch at an exclusive hotel in you hometown, or pampering yourself at home for the day? You are probably so stuck in a routine you think you don’t have the time for it.
Doing something different breaks the cycle of ‘doing’ life, and gives you an opportunity to experience a break from the norm and realize you’re missing out on some of life’s experiences that really matter. Trust me, you will thank me for this!

## Quit Watching TV

Seriously. Here’s a challenge: Say no to TV for a week, especially if you find it painstakingly impossible to do without the news. You will see how this makes a difference in your life, and you may realize how addictive the box and all the negativity it portrays really is.
Want to put meaning back in your life? Then turn off the TV and spend some time doing something meaningful. Simple!

## Do Something You’ve Always Wanted To Do

What’s that thing you always think about doing someday? Well, guess what? Your time has come, my friend, because you’re going to do it.
Step 1. Identify your ‘thing’.
Step 2. Go do it.
If this is an impossible two-step process for you right now, then start working towards, saving, learning or doing whatever it will take to make it happen. But make your first step!

## Find Your Purpose

One of the most liberating things you can do in life, in my opinion, is find your purpose. This will give you all the meaning you require for your life. It’s what life is about: finding your purpose and following through by living it.
Your purpose is what drives you, what wakes you up in the morning, what gives you energy. If you do nothing else with your life, seek your purpose with all your heart so you can reap the benefits of a meaningful life!

## Conclusion

Finding meaning in life is a process of discovery and self-reflection. It is not an easy task, but it is an important one. Whether you are the one looking for meaning in your life or you are looking for ways to help others find meaning, this guide offers some great starting points.

The meaning of life is the most important question that anyone can ask. The answer to this question, while simple, can be difficult to find. However, the search is worth it.

Finding meaning in life is not an easy task. But with a little bit of effort, you will be able to find meaning in your life and feel content with what you have.
