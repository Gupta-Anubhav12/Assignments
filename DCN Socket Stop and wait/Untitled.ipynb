    "### Theory::\n",
    "It is the simplest flow control method. In this, the sender will send one frame at a time to the receiver. The sender will stop and wait for the acknowledgment from the receiver. This time(i.e. the time between message sending and acknowledgement receiving) is the waiting time for the sender and the sender is totally idle during this time. When the sender gets the acknowledgment(ACK), then it will send the next data packet to the receiver and wait for the acknowledgment again and this process will continue as long as the sender has the data to send. This can be understood by the diagram below:\n",
